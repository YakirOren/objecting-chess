# Discording chess
its a chess game that looks like discord.
## Running

Run the [chessGraphics](https://gitlab.com/-/ide/project/YakirOren/objecting-chess/blob/master/-/chessGraphics.exe) first 

![Chess connecting](https://gitlab.com/-/ide/project/YakirOren/objecting-chess/blob/master/-/readmeImages/chessConnect.png)

Then run the back end, and if everything goes right the graphics will connect to the back end and the game will start.
